                    Learning: You use an LMS to deliver online courses and training material to the participants in your
                    class or training.

                    results and the effectiveness of your courses.

                <div class="panel-body">Benefits of an LMS
                    Using a learning management system has some big benefits over the old fashioned way of learning.

                    Consistency of learning
                    Delivering your course through an LMS keeps the content centralized so all the students have a
                    single source of content, instructions and questions. No excuses of old books or last years
                    material. Everybody is up-to-date.
                    Easy tracking & reporting
                    With an LMS you can easily track the progress of your students. You can see at a glance who finished
                    the course, who is half way and who didn't even start studying.
                    Create engaging courses
                    You can easily combine text, images and video in a learning management system. Which you cannot on
                    paper. Trough the use of more engaging material your students will keep their focus and learn more.
                    Better results through engagement and gamification
                    Because the learning material is more engaging, users will learn more. And using gamification in an
                    LMS keeps your users interested and challenged.

                    If you have technical talent in your team and you are on a tight budget, have a look at the free
                    learning management systems which are available. There are some solutions which you can install and
                    maintain yourself. If you don't want to install and setup software yourself, you have to choose a
                    commercial LMS.
